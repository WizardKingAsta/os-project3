## Implementation Details

## Benchmark Results

## Additional Notes
- Compiled and tested on ilab3.cs.rutgers.edu
- Unfortunately we were unable to fully implement everything due to poor timing, and the scale of this project.

## Difficulties & Issues
- **Memory Management**: We faced challenges in efficiently managing memory, especially while handling larger files and directories.  
- **Concurrency**: Ensuring thread safety and handling concurrent file operations was a complex aspect of the project.  
- **Debugging**: Debugging was particularly challenging due to the complexity of file system operations and interactions between various components.

## Collaboration and References
